# Matrix Chain Multiplication

This is a dynamic-programming solution to the matrix-chain order problem of wanting to find the minimum number of operations when multiplying *n* matrices together. As we have seen, this is by default an *O*(*n*!) problem, and hence is not solvable with any reasonable input. However, when using a native recursive solution, this turns into *O*($3<sup>*n*</sup>$). So, while an improvement over the factorial algorithm, this is still painfully slow on inputs larger than a few hundred or so. Now comes the dynamic-programming solution, reducing our time-complexiy in the worst-case to *O*(*n*<sup>3</sup>), a *massive* upgrade.
